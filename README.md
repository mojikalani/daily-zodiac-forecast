# Daily Horoscope

## Description
This app allows the user to input their zodiac information (Date of birth (Month/Day/Year), Location of birth) to retrieve a personalized forecast of their life using the Wester Horoscope Astrology api. Choosing the right api for our project led to some initial difficulties, however our team is confident in its choice. The Western Horoscope api provides plentiful amounts of information, making future feature implementation that much simpler. The Daily Horoscope app also tracks your search parameters into the local storage for ease of access; for navigating back to your prior search.

## How to use the APP
The app starts on a form page where you put your relevant information about your zodiac within the form (marked here with a red box)
